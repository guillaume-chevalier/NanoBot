# NanoBot

By Guillaume Chevalier and Raphael Doré.

This is a game I've coded with Raphael Doré in late 2013 for an introductory programming course. 

As of not importing external dependencies, in this project I have basically coded a phisic enging for a 2D side scrolling car game. 

We've left the Bin repertories so that the images of the levels exists, but we haven't compiled the .exe.
